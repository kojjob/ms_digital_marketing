## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Maps API (embedded in contact page)

### Tailwind CSS Implementation
The website uses Tailwind CSS for styling via CDN. This approach was chosen for simplicity and ease of maintenance:

- The Tailwind configuration is in `js/tailwind-config.js`
- Custom colors and theme extensions are defined in the configuration
- No build step is required, making deployment straightforward

## Contact Form Functionality

The website includes a functional contact form that can work in two ways:

### PHP-based Form Processing
If you're hosting the website on a server with PHP support:
1. The form submits to `process-form.php` which handles validation and email sending
2. Upon successful submission, users are redirected to `thank-you.html`
3. If there's an error, users are redirected to `error.html`

### Static Hosting Form Processing
For static hosting platforms (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel):
1. The form uses JavaScript to detect static hosting platforms
2. It then submits the form data to Formspree (you need to add your Formspree endpoint)
3. To set up Formspree:
   - Sign up at [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
   - Create a new form and get your endpoint
   - Replace `your-formspree-endpoint` in the contact.html file with your actual endpoint

## Setup and Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.)
- A modern web browser

### Local Development
1. Clone this repository or download it to your local machine
2. Open the project folder in your text editor
3. To view the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser

## Customization Guide

### Replacing Placeholder Content

#### Text Placeholders
Search for the following placeholders throughout the HTML files and replace them with actual information:
- `[Insert Address Here]` - Replace with the actual business address
- `[Client Name]` - Replace with actual client names in testimonials and case studies
- `[Insert Date]` - Replace with the current date in the legal documents
- `+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX` - Replace with the actual phone number

#### Images
1. Add your own images to the `/images/` directory
2. Update image references in HTML files
3. Currently, placeholder images are using unsplash.com random images. Replace these with your own:
   - Example: `<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/800x600/?digital-trends">` should be replaced with `<img src="../images/your-image-name.jpg">`

```
