# MS Digital Marketing Website - Deployment Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for deploying the MS Digital Marketing website to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying the website, ensure the following items are completed:

- [x] Replace all placeholder content with actual information
- [x] Configure Formspree endpoint for contact form
- [x] Set up Google Analytics with your tracking ID
- [x] Build and minify Tailwind CSS for production

## Building Tailwind CSS for Production

1. Navigate to the `tailwind-setup` directory:
```
cd tailwind-setup
```

2. Install dependencies:
```

```

3. Build minified CSS for production:

```

4. This will generate `tailwind.min.css` in the `css` directory.

5. Update all HTML files to use the minified CSS instead of the CDN:
```html
<!-- Replace this -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<script src="js/tailwind-config.js"></script>

<!-- With this -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tailwind.min.css">
```
